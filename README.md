# SimpleDER

## Overview

This is a lightweight library to compute Diarization Error Rate (DER).

Features **NOT** supported:

* Handling overlapped speech, *i.e.* two speakers speaking at the same time.
* Allowing segment boundary tolerance, *a.k.a.* the `collar` value.

For more sophisticated with these supports, please use
[pyannote-metrics](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-metrics) instead.
